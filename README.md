# [Dota React Client](https://wolfpilot.github.io/DotaReactClient/)

Dota 2 client built with React and Typescript as a take-home assignment. This project is based on Facebook's lovely [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool.

The requirements, loosely, were to build and host a Front-End UI in less than 8 hours using any framework and/or library and at least one API.

## Demo

## Features
- TSLint & Prettier
- Husky & lint-staged
- SASS

## Installation

1. Clone the repo from `https://github.com/wolfpilot/DotaReactClient.git`
2. CD into the newly created directory.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to spin up a local server.
4. The app should open automatically on port 3000. If not, then go to http://localhost:3000/ to see it in action.

## Details
The project took 8 - 9 hours from start to finish.

I took maybe 30 extra minutes to plan out the design, write the docs and to fix React Router's pathing in deployment.

Works best in Chrome, test in IE at your own peril.
